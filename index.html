      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm currently a production director and studio manager for a jewelry company.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Dallas, Texas</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love hanging out with my cat and going on food adventures in NYC. Survivor is my favorite TV show so I also host weekly Survivor nights at my apartment.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>If I never make it on Survivor, my dream job is to successfully launch the public safety app I designed and work with a team to make it accessible to everyone and widely prevalent in major cities.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Crown Heights.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It feels like a valuable skill to have in any industry so my interest is really two-fold currently- I want to continue to be an asset within my industry and I also want to learn all of the skills I need to be able to confidently pursue my own passion projects.</p>
